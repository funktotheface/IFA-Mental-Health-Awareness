# Be Hoppy üåàüê∏

Be Hoppy is a mental health awareness and information website tailored specifically for young children. The site aims to make learning about mental health both accessible and engaging by using a playful theme, a friendly frog mascot, and a calming color palette. 

## Features

- **Friendly Mascot**: A recurring frog mascot appears throughout the site to make the experience more relatable and fun for kids.
- **Color Scheme**: A soothing and simple combination of blue, green, and white helps create a calm environment for young users.

## Fonts

- **Headings**: [Space Grotesk](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Grotesk) is used for headings. This sans-serif font balances readability with a playful edge, adding style while keeping it accessible.
- **Main Content**: [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) is used for body text to ensure clarity and readability for young readers.

## Cards 

The cards are used to present the relevant information in an engaging but space saving way, while simultaneously providing subtle accessibility features for the reader. This is achieved by using a fading carousel style in order to present twice the content in the same space, the carousel will stop moving while a card is being hovered over in order to allow the reader time to engage with the content. The cards will also be highlighted on hover by being outset and displaying a pleasant blue box shadow.
